                                        I was that kid with the Lego and K&apos;nex; building things has always been my favorite thing to do.
                                        It&apos;s always exciting to figure out new ways of putting familiar things together. As I got older, I
                                        started enjoying taking apart electronics and trying to figure out what happened when you switched wires
                                        around or swapped parts.

                                        Eventually, I got into music in a big way; I still love it, and practice regularly to this day. I learned how
                                        to build instruments and do repair work and, for a while, I did some work as a luthier. During this whole
                                        time, I was busy playing with building websites and learning how the internet worked. I can&apos;t tell you
                                        how many mini-courses, tutorials, and other guided learning opportunities I&apos;ve gone through and broken
                                        down. For the longest time, I just kind of played with code.

                                        However, one day, while working onboard a ship, I realized that I could build my own tools for practice. As I
                                        looked into it, I realized that I was going to be unable to develop onboard the ships as WiFi was scarce,
                                        slow, and expensive. I was able to build a Raspberry Pi server to store math and coding tutorials, and I ended
                                        up studying enough to be able to get into VCC for their Software Systems Certificate. After completing the
                                        entire program, COVID hit. I ended up working and taking some time to determine where I wanted to go. After
                                        determining that I wanted to get more fluent in my coding skills and develop in a more practical way, I
                                        enrolled in BCIT&apos;s CST program.

                                        Over the last two years, I&apos;ve gone from having a rudimentary understanding of general web dev and an
                                        interest in technology to someone who has built multiple full-stack apps, programmed in more languages than I
                                        can remember, developed an appreciation for how the world connects, and a much stronger drive to see projects
                                        impact people in a much more positive way. I&apos;m driven by the desire to take the potential we have for
                                        change and apply it, even in small ways, to make the internet a better place.

                                        I feel lucky that I got to travel for work for years; I was able to take my love of music and perform for a
                                        living in so many different situations, and learn a lot about people and how connected the world is. I am
                                        currently developing a platform of tools for creating and practicing music, and I hope that I will be able to
                                        assist people in their own educational journeys.
