The system uses an Arduino Uno to monitor and control key variables affecting plant growth, such as light timing and soil moisture. Users can set specific parameters, including light schedules and minimum soil moisture levels, and the system autonomously adjusts these conditions for optimal plant health.
    
    This prototype demonstrates the potential of hyper-local food production by creating a climate-controlled growing environment that mimics large-scale agricultural practices. The project was inspired by smart farming concepts and aims to make farming more precise and efficient at the household level. Future enhancements include adding air humidity and temperature sensors, as well as integrating Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity for app-based monitoring and control.`,
