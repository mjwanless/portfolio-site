        "I’ve always been into building things. It started with Lego and K’nex, then shifted into electronics, instruments, and eventually code. I spent years performing music and working as a luthier, but I was always tinkering with websites and learning how things worked online.",

        "While working on ships, I built a Raspberry Pi server to study coding offline. That led me to pursue software more seriously, first through VCC and then BCIT’s CST program. Along the way, I developed full-stack apps, explored new technologies, and built a strong foundation in modern development.",

        "Today, I focus on creating tools that help people learn and create, especially in music and education. I love working on projects that bring creative and technical thinking together. If you’re curious or want to chat, feel free to reach out.",
