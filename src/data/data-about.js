        "I’ve always been into building things. It started with Lego and K’nex, then shifted into electronics, instruments, and eventually code. I spent years performing music and working as a luthier, but I was always tinkering with websites and learning how things worked online.",

        "While working on ships, I built a Raspberry Pi-based server to study coding when I lost access to the web. That led me to take classes at VCC and then join BCIT's CST program. During my time there, I worked on various projects of all types, worked with other developers, and learned a range of programming languages and tools. Learning about it was fun and I've been enjoying the journey ever since.",

        "Today, I focus on creating tools that help people learn and create, especially in music and education. I love working on projects that bring out the best in people. If you’re curious or want to chat, feel free to reach out.",
