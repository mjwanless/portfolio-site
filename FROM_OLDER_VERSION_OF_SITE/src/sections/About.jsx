                                I was that kid with the Lego and K'nex; building things has always been my favorite thing to do. It's always exciting
                                to figure out new ways of putting familiar things together. As I got older, I started enjoying taking apart
                                electronics and trying to figure out what happened when you switched wires around or swapped parts.

                                Eventually, I got into music in a big way; I still love it, and practice regularly to this day. I learned how to build
                                instruments and do repair work and, for a while, I did some work as a luthier. During this whole time, I was busy
                                playing with building websites and learning how the internet worked. I can't tell you how many mini-courses,
                                tutorials, and other guided learning opportunities I've gone through and broken down. For the longest time, I just
                                kind of played with code.
                            </p>

                                However, one day, while working onboard a ship, I realized that I could build my own tools for practice. As I looked
                                into it, I realized that I was going to be unable to develop onboard the ships as WiFi was scarce, slow, and
                                expensive. I was able to build a Raspberry Pi server to store math and coding tutorials, and I ended up studying
                                enough to be able to get into VCC for their Software Systems Certificate. After completing the entire program, COVID
                                hit. I ended up working and taking some time to determine where I wanted to go. After determining that I wanted to get
                                more fluent in my coding skills and develop in a more practical way, I enrolled in BCIT's CST program.

                                Over the last two years, I've gone from having a rudimentary understanding of general web dev and an interest in
                                technology to someone who has built multiple full-stack apps, programmed in more languages than I can remember,
                                developed an appreciation for how the world connects, and a much stronger drive to see projects impact people in a
                                much more positive way. I'm driven by the desire to take the potential we have for change and apply it, even in small
                                ways, to make the internet a better place.

                                I feel lucky that I got to travel for work for years; I was able to take my love of music and perform for a living in
                                so many different situations, and learn a lot about people and how connected the world is. I am currently developing a
                                platform of tools for creating and practicing music, and I hope that I will be able to assist people in their own
                                educational journeys.
